# Centinelas de la Fortaleza

Centinelas de la Fortaleza is a game where you will receive waves of enemies at your castle, and your objective is to defend and repair the castle.

To achieve this, players must be highly synchronized, as actions that need to be completed within a time limit will appear on their screens, such as "Repair the drawbridge." One player will receive the order and must communicate it to all players so it can be resolved. The orders that appear on one player's screen must be activated on the screen of the player who has that action available.
